*Motivations
For this project, I was interestested in analyzing data from AirBnB homes located in New York.
Specifically i analysed following questions.
1) What are the most common Airbnb property types in New York available for renting?
What is the availability of the properties throughout the year?
2) What is the average pricing of the properties for renting?Are there any seasonal spiking in pricing of the properties?
3)What are the most common streets in New York for Airbnb properties? What are most costliest streets in New York?
 Does the neighborhood group affect the pricing of the properties?
4)Can we use some of the features in the listing data to predict property pricing?
What are the most important factors affecting the cost of the properties?
